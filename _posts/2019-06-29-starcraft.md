StarCraft is a real-time strategy game composed of three races: Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. Players manage their attention on economic resources, infrastructure, unit building, unit control, and information. Through these core concepts, the player or agent attempts to defeat the opposition via mechanical skill and perceptive planning.

Nestled among the companies’ other fan favorites: Warcraft and Diablo, Starcraft enthusiasts have enjoyed multiple iterations of content over two decades. Blizzard’s legacy of timeless classics can still be enjoyed by millions around the world, and Starcraft is no exception.

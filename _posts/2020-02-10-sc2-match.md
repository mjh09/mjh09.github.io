  In the realm of StarCraft Esports and other sporting events abroad, predictions and betting go hand-in-hand.  With the help of community
sourced data of online and offline tournaments, I have created an app that enables users to generate predictions.

### The Data
 **Aquisition and formating:**
  The data source, [Aligulac](http://aligulac.com/), has a simple method of extraction: PostgreSQL database dump. Restoring the dump file to a local database and exporting relevant tables to CSV files was made easy by th pgAdmin GUI.

  **Data Wrangling and Baseline Prediction:**
  Isolating a select feature set required a handful of useful Pandas operations. I filtered off games played before the LOTV expansion, created  a new column to represent the winning player, and merged two tables to house the match and player rating information. A baseline classification prediction was made from the summary statistics.

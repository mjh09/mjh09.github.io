  Hello reader, my name is Matt. I am a(n) (aspiring)Data Scientist and a (current)student at Lambda 
School. I grew up in a small town in rural Oregon, and before signing up for Lambda School the 
majority of my work experience was in a small bronze foundry in Baker City: Blue Mountain Fine Art.
I have decided to pursue a career path I have zero prior experience with, and I fully expect an
arduous march to reshape myself and realign my future.

  Why the change? Simple life is good and for the most part easy, but for me, maybe too easy. I don't
have any real complaints about growing up in beautiful Baker Valley. Maybe I could say something about the
lack of (job)opportunity in rural areas, but honestly, a person can carve out a really nice life here if they
find a niche and stick with it. When I first took the job at 'the foundry' as we call it, or BMFA, a friend who
had his sights set on becoming an artist asked me a question I've never forgotten, 'what are your aspirations?'.
Suffice it to say I did not have a clear answer until now.

  So, what are my aspirations and why Data Science? I want to live a life that challenges me. 'Data Science'
as a term carries some broad connotations. It can mean a lot of things, and I like that. Do I get to nerd out
with math? Yes. Do I get to speak the language of computers? Sure. Can I combine the two with domain knowledge to 
elucidate a question that requires an accurate answer? Absolutely. All of which satisy my desire to 'do more' and 
be continually challenged with the next question.

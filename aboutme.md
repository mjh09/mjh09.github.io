Welcome to my About Me section. My name is Matthew, but Matt is okay. I am an aspiring Data Scientist who
joined a Data Science cohort at Lambda School.

My decision to undertake this path can be traced to a couple of key motivations: A pursuit of self-actualization
and a curiosity for technology. 

Prior to Lambda School I mostly worked as a laborer for a bronze foundry where I was a part of a team that brought
art sculptures to a metal medium.

On occasion I paint miniatures, spend time outdoors, play video games, consume literature and podcasts.
